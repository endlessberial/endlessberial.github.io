The girl slowly opened her eyes, on the hyphae dotted with white flowers, the breeze blew through the flush grass, the grass and flowers around her swayed happily, her long pale golden hair seemed to be studded with the starlight of the Milky Way, the distant leaping horizon connected with the endless blue sky, and the wilderness that traveled thousands of miles intersected at the end of the endless, the sun was looming among the white clouds, accompanied by the slight dew of the morning like a triangular mirror to solve the color of the rainbow, she had emerald-like pure and beautiful eyes, Like every grass beside her, maybe she also comes from the earth? The white dove flew low across the skyline, heading towards the emerald forest, its white wings covered with golden light, bringing back the nourishment that sustains life for the child, the ants under the roots of the coiled trees slowly marched forward, next to her, was a turquoise stream, out of nowhere swaying a group of water lamp boats, heading towards the meandering river, the clear water rippled in the blue waves, and every time it broke the countercurrent, it bloomed with colorful ripples, come, come, the immortal lights in the ship seemed to guide her. The dandelion that rose up against the wind kissed her tenderly on the cheek, and under the farewell of the wind, she walked along the creek, a small boat with lace seemed to have been waiting for her, she carefully boarded the boat, she stroked a white pigeon's soft feathers, thinking that the boat would lead her to the road home, stretching the river to the forest, towering trees holding up a shade of green.Under the cover of the trees, she found a dying pigeon in the depths of the forest, she picked it up with pity and curiosity, prayed for it, until it soared into the blue sky again, took her thoughts with it to the sky, rushed through the heaven above the clouds, under the protection of the white pigeons, she shuttled through the woods, the fireflies illuminated her way forward, the thorns and vines retreated, the fragrance of mahogany intertwined with the sound of cicadas and frogs, playing a symphony of life, in the hut deep in the forest, she saw her, When she staggered in again, she was already human, she could not bear to wake up the other her in the dream, but only put the kite in her hand into a kite, and then left, just at that moment, she remembered that she had also had wings, a pair of wings called kites, dreamlike memories kept shining, her eyes were already full of broken tears, and at the last minute before parting, she made a silent farewell, and in this way, ended her own story- "Dear, to the other side." Maybe you will return to this time that belongs to us again..." The girl in black looked at the still melodious clouds in the sky and prayed that heaven would welcome her soul, "There is no revocation here, there is no restart, we can only keep moving forward, so what is ahead?" "She hummed the old nursery rhyme for the wings that will never fly, for the years that passed in the flow of white flowers, goodbye...She pushed the boat, and the water carried her away, but left her heart so that she could meet her again in the shadows of the low night, turning into stars
